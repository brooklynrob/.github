# Project Governance
## Maintainers 
### What's a Maintainer?
Maintainers are those individuals who have write access or above in GitHub -- i.e., individuals with write access to protected branches (e.g., `main`) and in turn who can accept and merge pull requests into those branches. In most open source projects, maintainers act as a de facto board of directors who set the direction of the projects by din of their ability to commit changes. 

### Maintainer Selection for projects in the `goldmansachs` GitHub organization
New maintainers are elected by a majority vote of the existing maintainers. If there are an even number of maintainers than a tie vote means the new maintainer is not elected. 

### Maintainer Removal
* Resignation by the maintainer her/him/themself from their maintainer duties
* Resignation by maintainer who is also a GS employee from the firm
* Majority vote of the other maintainers 
    * If there are an even number of maintainers (other than the candidate for removal) than a tie vote means the new maintainer is not removed.
* At the discretion of the MD for Open Source matters or the Open Source Program Office Lead at Goldman Sachs. 

### Goldman Sachs Maintainer Requirement
All projects hosted in the [`goldmansachs` GitHub org](https://github.com/goldmansachs) must have at all times at least one maintainer who is a GS employee. In the event the only GS employee-maintainer leaves GS, a new GS employee-maintainer will be appointed by the MD for Open Source matters for Goldman Sachs or the Open Source Program Office Lead (who themselves may serve in this capacity if an interested employee can not be readily identified).

### Maintainer Meetings
The maintainers of projects hosted in the [`goldmansachs` GitHub org](https://github.com/goldmansachs) are expected to meet once per quarter to review on-going developer and progress of their projects, the project roadmap, etc.

Projects that do not hold such a maintainer meeting two quarter in row will be deemed candidates for archiving by the Goldman Sachs Open Source Program Office
